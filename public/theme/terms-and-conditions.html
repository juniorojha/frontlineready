                        <p>In connection with the Service, Sellers agree to provide to the Company a reserve amount indicating the minimum price at which the Seller will make a sale of the applicable vehicle (the “Reserve”) prior to the Company’s publication

                            level, has been placed on that vehicle.</P>
                        <span>B. BIDS</span>
                        <P>Each Buyer acknowledges and agrees that:</P>
                        <ul class="count-one">
                            <li>Each Bid submitted via the Service is binding on the Buyer and, if that Bid is the highest Bid at the point the Auction ends and the vehicle Reserve has been met (“the Successful Bid”), it commits the Buyer to the purchase
                                of the vehicle from the Seller at the Purchase Price;</li>
                            <li>In placing a Bid, the Buyer agrees to pay to the Company 6% of the Successful Bid value (capped at a maximum $8,000/£6,000/€6,000 plus VAT) or a minimum of $800/£500/€600 + VAT (in either case, “the Deposit”), should their
                                Bid be the Successful Bid;</li>
                            <li>The Deposit will be taken from the Buyer’s credit or debit card at the point their Bid is the Successful Bid;</li>

                        <p>We strongly recommend that an in-person inspection of vehicles by or on behalf of Bidders takes place; the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Company bears no risk associated with purchasing of a vehicle listed via the Service,
                            whether or not any inspection is performed.</p>

                            <li>that if the Buyer is acting for another party (their principal) they will disclose the identity of that principal to the Company and assist with such steps as the Company may require to allow the Company to undertake such identity
                                and related checks into the principal as the Company may determine;</li>

                        <p>The Company may add new services for additional fees and charges, or add or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion, although fees and charges for specific services already ordered (for
                            example vehicles already listed) will not be altered.</p>
                        <p class="border">The prices listed by Sellers on the Service exclude government fees and taxes, registration and titling fees, regulatory and electronic processing charges, inspection charges, and any other fees required by law, any or all of which
                            may be added to the listed price to arrive at the final Purchase Price of a particular vehicle. Amounts listed on the Service are in UK Sterling (GBP), in Euro (€) or in United States Dollar ($).</p>
                        <span>B. PAYMENT INFORMATION</span>
                        <p>All payments made by the Buyer to the Company shall be facilitated through Stripe, Inc., the Company’s third party payment processing service. We do not accept cash. The Company does not directly capture or store any payment information.
                            Buyers authorise Stripe Inc to pre-authorise any amount applicable to fees payable to the Company in connection with Successful Bids and agree that payment collection will be subject to Stripe’s terms of service which can be
                            found at https://stripe.com/us/terms.</p>
                        <p>Buyers agree that all information that Buyers provide in connection with use of the Service will be accurate, complete and current.
                        </p>
                        <p>Users acknowledge and agree to the Company’s and Stripe Inc’s rights to perform financial and background checks on Users when either we or Stripe Inc deem it necessary to meet legal obligations under Money Laundering and other
                            regulations, and our right, without incurring liability to anyone, to decline to complete any transaction (at any stage) where we deem it necessary to avoid potential breach of such obligations.</p>
                        <span>C. BREACH BY THE BUYER</span>
                        <p>In the event that the sale of the vehicle to the Buyer is not completed because of any breach by the Buyer of these Terms, the Buyer undertakes to compensate the Company in full in respect of the Seller's Commission that would
                            have been payable had the Buyer not been in breach.</p>
                        <span>D. ACCOUNT CANCELLATION</span>
                        <p>Users may cancel their Company account at any time; however, there are no refunds for or in connection with cancellation absent a breach of these Terms by the Company, provided that Seller’s fees may be refundable by the Company
                            solely prior to a Seller’s listing being published. In the event that the Company, acting reasonably, suspends or terminates a User’s account or this Agreement, the User understands and agrees that it shall receive no refund
                            or the return of any content or data associated with that account, apart from as provided under our Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p class="border">Buyers with complaints about vehicles purchased from Sellers through the Service should contact the Seller directly. Buyers who are UK or EU consumers and who purchase vehicles from trade Sellers, may have certain cancellation
                            rights [see FAQ].</p>
                        <span>7. COLLECTION OF THE VEHICLE</span>
                        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Seller, the sale of the vehicle will complete within 7 days of Auction end. The Seller will only release the vehicle to the Buyer once the Seller has received cleared funds to the amount
                            of the Purchase Price less the Deposit (usually 94% of the Purchase Price, taking into account the actual amount of the Deposit paid to the Company under section 4 above).</p>
                        <p>The Buyer will collect and remove the purchased vehicle at the Buyer’s expense.</p>
                        <p>The Buyer will be wholly responsible for packing, handling, insurance and transport of the vehicle on collection and for complying with all import or export regulations in connection with the vehicle and any taxes or duties applicable
                            to the purchase and transport of the vehicle.</p>
                        <p class="border">If the Seller has stored the vehicle with the Company during the Auction and the vehicle is sold, the Buyer will be wholly responsible for any removal, insurance, storage or other charges or expenses incurred by the Company in
                            the event the Buyer does not remove the vehicle within 7 days of Auction end, and the Buyer will indemnify the Company against all charges, costs, including any legal costs and fees, expenses and losses suffered by the Company
                            by reason of the Buyer’s failure to remove the vehicle, including any charges due from any third party storage provider. All such sums due will be payable on demand.</p>
                        <span>8. INDEMNITY</span>

                            of intellectual property law would in their location, and constitutes a contractual obligation binding to Users beyond the applicable intellectual property laws.

                        <p class="border">As noted above, vehicles are sold by Sellers not the Company, and the Service is provided on an “as is” basis; we do not offer any warranty or guarantee or accept any liability for Seller Content or other Content, for any description
