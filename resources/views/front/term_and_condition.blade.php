     a charge. If you decide to withdraw your car then you will be obligated to
     cover the costs we have incurred so far. Typically, these will be charged

     at site and travel to and from the Consignment Visit location), and £75
     per hour charged for all other production costs – for example and not

If you decide to not take part in the consignment meeting as agrranged on the
day of consignment review, then the consignment will cease at the point and you
will be liable for any costs incurred, i.e. the Consigner’s time charged at the
equivalent of £100 p/h for all travel time (to and from the location) and time
spent at the location. This will be invoiced to you by Curating Cars Limited
and payment is due within 14 days.<br>

6.6 It is your responsibility to make sure there is no personally identifiable
information in the vicinity of where the consignment visit will take place,
e.g. road signs / house name or number or anything else that will identify your
address. If there are signs or any other medium that will compromise your
personal information / location then it is your responsibility to make sure
they are removed or covered up during our visit. We cover the consigned
vehicle’s registration number with our own logo plates if requested to protect
the identity of the consigned vehicle only, i.e. so it can’t be copied and used
fraudulently on a similar vehicle. We do not cover any other number plates for
other cars you may own that could be captured in the background of the images /
videos – this is your responsibility to either move the vehicles or cover up
the number plates if you wish to do so.<br>

6.7 Adjusted Commission Sales – we work with you, the Private Seller / Trade
Seller, to agree and set a realistic Reserve value in line with market pricing
– we don’t take on vehicles with unrealistic pricing. If, however, an auction
is close to meeting the Reserve then we may, at our discretion and in the
interest of a successful sale, reduce the Reserve price lower than that agreed
with you. However, the adjustment will take into account the amount of
commission due to make sure you get at least the agreed reserve back. For
example, if the original reserve is say £50,000 and we reduce it to £49,800,
then £200 of our Buyer’s Premium will be paid to you, the Private Seller /
Trade Seller, to make up the deficit against the agreed reserve. This will
bring you back to receiving the same minimum amount that was agreed during the
Valuation process.<br>

We will not be liable in any way or under any circumstances for any loss or
damage that you may incur as a result of such Vehicle Listings, nor for any
errors or omissions in Vehicle Listings. &nbsp;Use of and reliance upon Vehicle
Listings is entirely at your own risk.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.2 Bidders may Bid on any&nbsp;Item / Vehicle&nbsp;at any time during an
Auction if they have successfully stored and validated their own credit card
and have sufficient credit limit to cover the cost of the Buyer Premium – bids
are always made in the currency of the vehicles origin. Example if the vehicle
is based in the UK it will be GBP or if the vehicle is from the UAE it will be
in Emirati Dirham.  We are a UK, Swiss, UAE and Malaysia operating service to
cover the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East and Asia however we will convert
to vehicles country and sale local, however this may show an exchange rate difference
that fluctuates as our system utilises XE services for the conversion which
Curating Cars cannot guarantee the accuracy. If an Auction Listing is displayed
to a Bidder in any other currency apart from that in which the vehicle resides
then they must contact Us first before placing their Bid – it’s likely their
Internet browser is changing the currency prefix due to their own preferences,
or running a browser plugin that is changing the prefix – this is not a valid
reason for requesting a cancellation or amendment of a Bid/s.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.3 A bid is generally an irrevocable offer made by a Bidder to a Private
Seller / Trade Seller to buy the&nbsp;listed Item / Vehicle.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.4 Bids (including winning bids) may be cancelled or retracted in limited and
exceptional circumstances: these are at the sole discretion of Curating Cars.
However, bids will not be cancelled or retracted if the Bidder has bid in
error, or not read or understood the Bidding rules that are outlined in these
Terms and Conditions and summerised on the Bidding panel from which they
confirmed their Bid, e.g. ‘Bidding automatically advances to the Your Bid
value’, i.e. there is no automated incremental bidding functionality – see
Section 7.20 Unrestricted Bidding.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.5 Bidders are responsible for ensuring that they have sufficient funds
available to cover their&nbsp;Bid(s) and&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;Premium – Bidders can
not and must not bid on behalf of any third party.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.6 Bidders and Buyers are required to conduct their own research and due
diligence before placing a Bid on an Item / Vehicle or purchasing a Vehicle.
All vehicles, no matter what the sale type, are sold on an “as is” basis. Any
description or expression of manufacturers, models, variants, special editions,
authenticity and vehicle condition, e.g. bodywork, electrics or mechanics by Curating
Cars or the Private Seller / Trade Seller should be validated by the
prospective Bidder / Buyer, or via an independent inspection. No warranties are
given or implied whatsoever. Curating Cars representatives are not qualified
vehicle inspectors. Also, as per Section 6.1 it is the Seller’s responsibility
to disclose any outstanding finance or previously recorded accident history to Curating
Cars. All Vehicles are free from finance and previously recorded accident
history unless otherwise stated on the Vehicle Listing. Curating Cars may
action their own HPi and accident checks, if that is actioned then details will
be included on the Vehicle Listing. If a Buyer later finds out the vehicle does
have outstanding finance, or has previously recorded accident history, then it
is the responsibility of the Buyer to seek resolution / compensation from the
Seller; Curating Cars have no responsibility unless it was stated on the
Vehicle Listing the car was free from outstanding finance, or previously
recorded accident history and it was not. The Buyer Premium is non-refundable
under any circumstance.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.7 When a Bidder places a Bid on a Vehicle at Auction that is the highest Bid
at the end of an Auction, and is on or above the Seller’s reserve price, then
this Bid shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Seller, known as the
Winning Bid and thus creating a legally binding contract between us, the Bidder
and the Private Seller or Trade Seller under which the Bidder is obliged to
complete on the sale of the Vehicle (within 7 days from the date of Auction
close) at the price of their Winning Bid and pay the associated Buyer Premium
to us (within 24hrs of the Auction close) – the Private Seller / Trade Seller
is obliged to sell the Vehicle for the same.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.8 All Buyers and Sellers shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of these
Terms&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Conditions and may pursue independent legal remedies
against one another for non-performance of any of their respective obligations
hereunder.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.9 Payment for an Item / Vehicle&nbsp;must be made by the method requested by
the Private Seller / Trade Seller within 7 days of the&nbsp;Auction close.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.10 Sellers / Trade Sellers shall be under no obligation to release any
Vehicle to Buyers until they have received any and all sums due in cleared
funds. &nbsp;Private Sellers / Trade Sellers may release&nbsp;an Item /
Vehicle&nbsp;prior to receipt of monies due but do so entirely at their own
risk.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.11 Legal title in and to&nbsp;an Item / Vehicle&nbsp;shall transfer
to&nbsp;the Buyer&nbsp;only upon receipt of any and all sums due&nbsp;to
the&nbsp;Private Seller / Trade Seller, notwithstanding early transfer of
possession.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.12 Buyers may, in limited circumstances, have a legal right to return&nbsp;an
Item / Vehicle&nbsp;to a Private Seller / Trade Seller. No refunds will be made
to the Buyer by Curating Cars for the Buyer Premium; unless for reasons as
contained in&nbsp;<i>Section 12.2</i>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.13 Distance Selling – you acknowledge that the Consumer Protection (Distance
Selling) Regulations 2000 do not apply to the sale of goods by Auction and thus
do not apply to this Website or any transactions completed through it. This is
because as a Buyer / Bidder you have the opportunity to visit the Vehicle prior
to purchase giving reasonable notice to do so, and completing the necessary ID
checks, i.e. proof-of-ID. Also, we aim to give Bidders / Buyers as much
information about the Vehicle as we can, e.g. via a significant number or
images and / or video footage. Our processes allows Bidders / Buyers to make an
informed decision on the Vehicle before deciding to place a Bid and
subsequently win the car at Auction – https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.14 Bidders agree to pay the&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;Premium should their bid win
the&nbsp;Auction. This fee will be displayed at the time of bidding (labelled Curating
Cars Fee) and confirming a bid enters the bidder into this legal agreement.
&nbsp;We automatically charge the&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;Premium to the stored payment
card at the end of the&nbsp;Auction. &nbsp;If this fails for whatever reason
then the Buyer must manually pay the outstanding&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;Premium by
bank transfer to us within 24hrs of the&nbsp;Auction close. &nbsp;Bank details
will be supplied.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.15 Buyers must not fail to pay for any&nbsp;Item / Vehicle&nbsp;purchased,
whether sold at a fixed price or&nbsp;Auction. This excludes where the Private
Seller / Trade Seller materially alters the terms of the sale after a Bidder
has&nbsp;Bid or agreed to purchase.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.16 Buyers must not seek to avoid the payment of any Auction fees, e.g. the
Buyer’s Premium that is or will be owed to us, or manipulate the fee structure
or fee payment process in any way. For example, once a bid is placed by a
Bidder, then as per these terms set out herein, that bid is binding, and
subsequently when the live auction ends, and the reserve has also been met,
then the credit or debit card stored against the high Bidder will be charged
the Buyer’s Premium immediately. To prevent manipulation of this process,
Bidders are blocked from removing or updating their stored card in My Account
when they are currently the highest Bidder on a live auction. This update /
removal block is only released when the high Bidder is outbid.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.17 Unless otherwise agreed, if we do not receive the Buyer Premium within 24
hour of the Auction close from the Bidder that placed the Winning Bid on a
Vehicle, or either notifies us at any time that they no longer wish to honour
their Auction Purchase, then this is considered a breach of contract. The
Private Seller / Trade Seller are then free to either keep the Vehicle, or sell
it to another party – and they not obligated to sell it to the Bidder that
placed the Winning Bid. However, the Bidder that placed the Winning Bid on the
Vehicle is still liable for the Buyer Premium and has 14 days to pay the monies
owed to us. If settlement of the debt is not received within 14 days then we
will instruct our debt recover service, currently Marks Recoveries &amp; Legal
Services, to collect the amount owing plus any interest and/or late payment
charges. In such circumstances the Bidder that placed the Winning Bid will also
be liable to cover the costs of this collection method i.e. debt collection,
solicitor or court fees, our instructed party will add this sum to the
outstanding debt on our behalf.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.18 Failure to pay any amount owed on time will result in late payment charges
which shall be calculated in accordance with The Late Payment of Commercial
Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (as amended) from the date the payment was originally
due until the date of actual payment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.19 We reserve the right to charge an administration fee for any late payment
notices which we send to you in the event of your late payment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.20 Unrestricted Bidding – our auction platform will allow the highest Bidder
on any Auction to bid again if they so wish. There is no system checking or
Bidder warning placed on this within the bidding process. It is up to the
Bidder and their own bidding strategy to decide on how much they want to bid
(over and above the £200 minimum increment level), when they want to bid during
the Auction live time frame, and if they want to bid again when already the
highest Bidder; even when the Reserve met status has been announced (see
section 7.22).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.21 Reserve Announcements – please be aware that we may or may not disclose
when the reserve has been met – just like a traditional auction house. If we do
disclose when the reserve has been met then this will be shown on the listing,
for example, within comments section labelled ‘Ask Owner’. In the event of a
highest Bidder that bids again on an auction whereby the Reserve has been met
and announced by us, then they are still liable for the latest bid and
contractually bound if they subsequently win the Auction sale at that latest
and Winning Bid.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7.22 Trade Sales – we, Curating Cars, Auction Vehicles that belong to both
Private Sellers and Trade Sellers. Buying from a Trade Seller through Curating
Cars is the same as buying through a Private Seller, and notification of the
sale type will be clearly visible on the Auction Listing. For Trade Sales,
Bidders and Buyers are still required to conduct their own research and due
diligence, as outlined in section 7.6 above, before placing a Bid on an Item /
Vehicle, or purchasing a Vehicle. All Vehicles, no matter what the sale type,
i.e. via Private Sellers or Trade Sellers, are sold on a “sold as seen” basis.
As a result there are no warranties given, or implied whatsoever, or any additional
cover on the Vehicle provided. As a reminder, the Buyer Premium is
non-refundable under any circumstance.</span></p>

You are responsible for paying all such fees. Failure to pay fees due may mean
that we seek to collect fees owed by other means, including (but not limited
to) invoicing, use of collection agencies and legal action where we deem it
appropriate.<br>

12.6 We reserve the right to change both fees and fee structures on giving you

12.7 In the spirit of transparency all sold vehicles will be published on the

Private Seller or any other person to remove or hide a sold vehicle for
whatever reason from the sold page, or any other area of the Website or
external promotional material e.g. marketing advertisements, will be denied.
Also any request by any party, e.g. a Bidder, Buyer, Trade Seller, Private
Seller or any other person to remove or modify the sold price that is publicly
shown on the listing or any other external material, digital, print or
otherwise, will also be denied.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
12.8 We can at any time, and at our sole discretion, manually request an
authorisation via our payment provider against a stored payment card to the
Buyer Premium value associated to a maximum Bid, that a Bidder has placed on
any currently live Auction. For example, we may exercise this right if the
stored card has failed authorisation in the past, or We suspect it will fail in
the future, or for any reason. This authorisation may show on the Bidder’s
payment card statement as an authorisation, and it may, depending on the
payment card providers own terms and conditions, utilise a proportion of the
credit limit on the account until the authorisation is released.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
12.9 Consignment Fee – this may also be referred to as the Photography Fee, and
is due payable to Us by a Seller upon agreement to the the Consignment Visit.
The Seller must pay this fee in full, and be received by Us, not less than 24
hours prior to the Consignment Visit. If in the event the Seller requests a
cancellation of the Consignment Visit greater than 24 hours from the visit date
/ time then We will refund the fee if so requested by the Seller, e.g. the
Seller no longer wishes their Vehicle to be Auctioned by Us. However, if the
requested cancellation is received less that 24 hours from the Consignment Visit
date / time, then this payment is deemed non-refundable, and if requested by
the Seller to re-book the Consignment Visit for a future date / time, then the
Seller must pay this fee a second time, and prior to the Consignment Visit
being confirmed.</span></p>

it is the Seller’s / Trade Seller’s responsibility to disclose to us, for
inclusion in the auction listing, any known history items including and not
limited to; outstanding finance and stolen / accident recorded history.
&nbsp;Failure to disclose this information will result in non-acceptance of
Vehicle consignment, or removal of Vehicle consignment if a later check is
actioned by a Bidder / Buyer and successfully validated by us. &nbsp;In the
latter case, i.e. the Auction is active and removed, then the Private Seller /
Trade Seller will be charged 5% +VAT of the agreed reserve price or of the
final bid, whichever is the greater sum. This is to cover our costs of
consigning the vehicle during the auction preparation process, which includes
but is not limited to our time invested to appraise the vehicle, consider its
market position, cover any travel and subsistence costs to view the vehicle and
incurred marketing costs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
29.2&nbsp;<b>Outstanding Finance</b>&nbsp;– it is illegal to advertise a
Vehicle for Auction without disclosing any outstanding finance agreement or
loan assigned. &nbsp;If in the event the Vehicle is consigned with outstanding
finance assigned, then this will be clearly mentioned in the Vehicle Listing.
&nbsp;It is the Buyer’s and Seller’s / Trade Seller’s responsibility to manage
the completion of the transaction in line with English law, for example, the
Private Seller / Trade Seller must inform the finance company of notice to sell
the Vehicle, request a settlement figure from the finance company and subsequently
settle all outstanding finance before accepting any monies from the Buyer.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
29.3&nbsp;<b>Private Seller / Trade Seller Compliance</b>&nbsp;– it is the
Private Seller / Trade Seller’s responsibility to settle all outstanding
finance on the Vehicle before the Buyer transfers any funds, partial or full,
against the final winning bid value. &nbsp;If the Private Seller / Trade Seller
defaults on this obligation, i.e. all outstanding finance is not cleared within
7 days of the auction close, then the Buyer has the right to cancel the
contract and is not bound to complete the transaction. &nbsp;Curating Cars
will, in this case, refund the Buyer the Curating Cars Fee in full within 7
days of notice. &nbsp;The Private Seller / Trade Seller will be charged 5% +VAT
of the agreed reserve price or of the final bid, whichever is the greater sum.
This is to cover our costs of consigning the vehicle during the auction
preparation process, which includes but is not limited to our time invested to
