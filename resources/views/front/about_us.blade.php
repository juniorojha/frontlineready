                        <p>At Front Line Ready, we do exactly what our name says â€“ provide front line ready cars to automotive dealers. We're passionate about vehicles and making sure retail dealers have an effective and efficient method of acquiring inventory.  We understand the challenges in today's environment with shortages of inventory and more competition for every vehicle.  Our goal is to help our partner dealers buy and sell more cars. Period.</p>

                        <span>How it Works</span>
                        <p>We buy vehicles and put them through a rigorous inspection and reconditioning process to make sure they meet our high standards. Each Front Line Ready vehicle will have a current Texas Inspection and be ready for you to sell immediately on your lot without time consulting and costly reconditioning.  We then post them to our dealer only auction portal where our dealer partners can participate in our 10-day auction process or "buy it now".  We then deliver the vehicle to the winning dealer.  We then certify our cars for 30 days or 1,000 miles. <br/>
                        It's that simple.  No standing around a live auction all day.  No more auction buy fees.  No more waiting for the next trade in. <br/> Contact us to learn more.

                        <p>The process at Front Line Ready is very simple.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Register as a dealer (see below).</p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Visit our site and review our inventory.</p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Each listing will have pictures and detailed vehicle information.  If you have additional questions on a vehicle, call us.</p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Each listing will have a starting minimum floor bid and a Buy it Now price.</p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Each listing will give the option to submit a maximum proxy bid or next bid increment ($100 bid increments) </p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">Each listing lasts 10 days with a stated countdown unless the Buy it Now option is exercised.</p></li>
                            <li><p style="margin-left:3px;width: 100%;text-align: justify;">If you win, the vehicle is delivered to your facility.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>That's it.  Sound easy enough?</p>
